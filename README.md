# Number Guesser
In this fun, two-person game, users will enter a minimum and maximum number to set a range.  Then, fancy code will run in the background to select in a random number in the users' range.  The users can then guess as many times as they would like to try to guess the random number.  When a user correctly guesses the number, a winner card will display showing the stats of the game.

## Key Takeaways
In this project, I executed the following concepts:
**1. Flexbox** - Much of my layout is done using Flexbox.  Flexbox was critical in my alignment and spacing for both the desktop and mobile view.
**2. DOM Manipulation** - Based on just a handful of user inputs, the game becomes personalized and gives the user the gratification of seeing their own information being displayed.
**3. Conditionals** - Many of the error messages display as a result of a conditional, taking into account multiple variables set up using querySelectors.
